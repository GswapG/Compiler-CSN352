# General
1. run run.bat or run.sh from project root to run parser
2. dont worry if imports dont work in files inside src (python module imports work this way)
3. lexer.py is outdated, and has been refactored into lexer_class.
4. Any changes to lexer need to be made to lexer_class


# TODO
- [ ] Implicit Type Conversion
- [ ] Pass By Reference
- [ ] Function declaration and definition separately
